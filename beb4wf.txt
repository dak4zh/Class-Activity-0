I took the intro to embedded systems class last semester.
Projects included creating timers, moving motors in specific ways, and creating an electronic level.

I found embedded systems really interesting, but as an electrical engineer major, software isn't
really my strong point. I'm really hoping to gain a deeper understanding of the software aspects
of embedded systems in this class.
