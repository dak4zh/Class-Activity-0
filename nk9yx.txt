Nayiri Krzysztofowicz, nk9yx

Background:
I've taken Intro to Embedded (ECE 3430), FPGA Lab (ECE 4501), CS 2150,
and am currently taking Operating Systems (CS 4414). I've programmed 
in C++, C, Python, Java, and x86 Assembly. I have little familiarity 
with computer architecture and no outside of class experience with embedded
systems.

Interests:
I am very interested in embedded systems and digital logic, everything
between transistor-level design and microcontroller programming in C.
I hope to gain a deeper knowledge of embedded systems in this class, as
well as experience with microcontroller applications.
