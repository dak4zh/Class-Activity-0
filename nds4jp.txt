Background:
I have taken Intro to Embedded (ECE 3430) and I'm currently taking Operating
Systems (CS 4414). This course will be my first experience with RTOS. My
strongest programming languages are Python, C/C++, and Swift.

Interests/What to Expect:
I really would like to improve upon my C programming skills and learn about
more complex embedded systems. I hope to become better at writing clean and
efficient code for embedded systems by taking this class.
